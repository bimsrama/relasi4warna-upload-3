# This file is for documentation purposes during the refactoring phase.
# When ready, this will become the main FastAPI application entry point.

# Future implementation:
# from fastapi import FastAPI
# from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
# from routes import auth, quiz, report, admin, payment, blog, analytics
# 
# app = FastAPI(title="Relasi4Warna API", version="2.0.0")
# 
# # CORS
# app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)
# 
# # Include routers
# app.include_router(auth.router)
# app.include_router(quiz.router)
# app.include_router(report.router)
# app.include_router(admin.router)
# app.include_router(payment.router)
